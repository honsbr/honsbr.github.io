<p>Key Types of Neural Networks
Deep learning encompasses several neural network architectures, each suited for specific tasks:
Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs): The simplest architecture, where information flows in one direction—from input to output. These are commonly used for tasks like classifying emails as spam or not spam.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Designed for image-related tasks, CNNs excel at recognizing patterns like edges, shapes, and textures in pixels. They’re widely used in facial recognition, medical imaging, and object detection.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Built for sequential data, RNNs retain memory of past inputs, making them ideal for tasks like language modeling, time-series prediction, or stock market forecasting.
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Consist of two networks—a generator that creates data and a discriminator that evaluates it. GANs are responsible for realistic CGI in entertainment and art that mimics styles of famous painters.
Autoencoders: These networks compress data into a smaller representation and then reconstruct it. They’re useful for tasks like denoising images or reducing file sizes while maintaining quality.
Transformers: Transforming the way sequential data is processed, transformers analyze entire sequences simultaneously instead of step by step. They power advanced applications in natural language processing, like real-time translation and sophisticated chatbots.
